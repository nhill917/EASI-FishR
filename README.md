Here, we provide example code and application of the Ecological Assessment of the Sustainable Impacts of Fisheries (EASI-Fish) ecological risk assessment approach developed by Griffiths et al. (2019) and detailed in Hill et al. (in prep). We apply EASI-Fish to two example species, Alopias vulpinus (ALV) and Carcharhinus longimanus (OCS) and two fisheries to show how this approach can be applied to multiple species and fisheries simultaneously.
